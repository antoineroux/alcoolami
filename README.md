Alcoolami
=========

## The project

Alcoolami is a stupid project meant to be used only in the context of one bachelor's party. It requires an ethylometer.

The application lets participants input enter their location and alcool concentration at different moments during the
party. It then shows the results on a map.

## Running

### While developing

You have two options. From the command line:

```
./gradlew run
```

Alternatively, you can run the class `AlcoolAmi`` from your IDE.

Note that changes on static resources require a restart to be taken into account.

### On production

TBD (actually, that might never exist).

## License

The project is licensed under the WTFPL.
